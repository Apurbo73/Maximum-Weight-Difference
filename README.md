### Maximum Weight Difference:



### 🧠 **Goal**:

Chef and his son split **N items** (with known weights) into **two groups**, where **one group has exactly K items**.
Chef carries the heavier group; his son carries the other.
We need to **maximize the difference** between the weights they carry.

---

### ✅ **Key Idea**:

To **maximize the difference**, try both of these:

1. **Son gets the K lightest items** → So Chef carries the heaviest ones.
2. **Son gets the K heaviest items** → So Chef is forced to take the light ones.

Then pick **the better of the two** options.

### 🧮 **Steps in Code**:

1. **Input**: Read number of test cases `T`.

2. For each test case:

   * Read `N` (number of items) and `K`.
   * Read the `N` weights into a vector.
   * Calculate the total weight of all items.
   * Sort the weights in ascending order.

3. **Two Scenarios**:

   * **Case 1**: Son gets the `K` lightest items (first `K` in sorted list).
   * **Case 2**: Son gets the `K` heaviest items (last `K` in sorted list).

4. **Compute weight difference**:

   * In each case, compute weight carried by Chef = total - son's weight.
   * Then compute `abs(ChefWeight - SonWeight)`.
   * Output the **maximum** of both cases.

### 📦 Example:

If weights are: `1 2 3 4 5`, N = 5, K = 2
Sorted: `1 2 3 4 5`, Total = 15

* Son gets `1 2` → sum = 3 → Chef gets `12` → diff = 9
* Son gets `4 5` → sum = 9 → Chef gets `6` → diff = 3
  **Max difference = 9**

The problem revolves around dividing N items with given weights into two groups such that one group has exactly K items. Chef's son demands to carry exactly K items, and Chef will carry the heavier of the two groups. To maximize the difference in the weight carried between Chef and his son, we consider two scenarios: one where the son gets the K lightest items, and another where he gets the K heaviest items. In both cases, we calculate the total weight the son carries, subtract it from the overall total to get Chef’s share, and compute the absolute difference.

By evaluating both scenarios, we choose the one that gives the maximum difference between the two groups. Sorting the weights makes it easy to pick the lightest or heaviest K items. This ensures we test both extremes: minimum burden and maximum burden on the child, thus maximizing the possible difference between Chef’s and his son’s loads. The approach is efficient and works within the given constraints.
